# 🔤 Word Search Generator

A simple **Word Search Generator** built in **Python 3**, capable of placing multiple words in random directions within a square grid.  
Each game is unique — words are randomly positioned horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, while empty spaces are filled with random letters.
